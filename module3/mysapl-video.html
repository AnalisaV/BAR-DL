					<p>Today we'll be learning about the San Antonio public library app. The first thing you'll need is your library card.
					Next we'll need to go to the library's website. Once there you're going to go to the account button located at the top.
					From there you'll enter your library card information and if you haven't already done so you will create a password. 
					Once you've set up your online account on the library website you will then go to the appstore for iphones. 
					Once there you will search for and then download the mySAPL app.
					When it's finished downloading you will then look for mySAPL app icon and click on it.
					This is what the home screen looks like.
					Once you're in the app in order to start checking out books or do anything like that you'll need to go to the mysap icon located in the middle.
					When you click on it this screen pops up. 
					Here is where you will add in your library card number and your password.
					Now you are able to see all of your Library account information.
					Next let's go down to the bottom and click the explore button. 
					You are now at the apps home screen and this is where you can begin to look at books, recent arrivals, just ordered, and bestsellers.
					Let's say you already know which book you would like to look for you would go to the bottom and click the search button. 
					At the top of the screen you will find the search bar.
					This is where you'll enter your book title. 
					I went ahead and search for cat in the hat.
					If this is the book I would like I would then go and click on it and i'll begin to see all the information the library has about the book.
					If this is a book I'm interested in I can go to the left icon at the top and click it to have a menu drop-down. 
					This menu has different options. In my case I would like to place the book on hold for hit
2:07the whole button and then have the
2:10option to pick which library i would
2:12like the book to be held that for me
2:14after selecting the library of it like

2:27holes area if you choose to cancel her
