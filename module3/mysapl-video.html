					<p>Today we'll be learning about the San Antonio public library app. The first thing you'll need is your library card.<br>
					Next we'll need to go to the library's website. Once there you're going to go to the account button located at the top.<br>
					From there you'll enter your library card information and if you haven't already done so you will create a password. <br>
					Once you've set up your online account on the library website you will then go to the appstore for iphones. <br>
					Once there you will search for and then download the mySAPL app.<br>
					When it's finished downloading you will then look for mySAPL app icon and click on it. <br>
					This is what the home screen looks like.<br>
					Once you're in the app in order to start checking out books or do anything like that you'll need to go to the mysap icon located in the middle.<br>
					When you click on it this screen pops up. <br>
					Here is where you will add in your library card number and your password.<br>
					Now you are able to see all of your Library account information.<br>
					Next let's go down to the bottom and click the explore button. <br>
					You are now at the apps home screen and this is where you can begin to look at books, recent arrivals, just ordered, and bestsellers.<br>
					Let's say you already know which book you would like to look for you would go to the bottom and click the search button. <br>
					At the top of the screen you will find the search bar.<br>
					This is where you'll enter your book title. <br>
					I went ahead and search for cat in the hat.<br>
					If this is the book I would like I would then go and click on it and i'll begin to see all the information the library has about the book.<br>
					If this is a book I'm interested in I can go to the left icon at the top and click it to have a menu drop-down. <br>
					This menu has different options. In my case I would like to place the book on hold for hit<br>
					2:07the whole button and then have the<br>
					2:10option to pick which library i would<br>
					2:12like the book to be held that for me<br>
