					<p>0:20library dot O R G once they're in the near the middle of the screen</p>
					<p>0:26nuclear work says applications or</p>
					<p>0:32as you scroll down the page a little bit you'll see three goals three music three</p>
					<p>0:37goal is a download service which is provided free of charge as long as you</p>
					<p>0:41have a library card and it gives you access to millions and millions of songs</p>
					<p>0:45all of them available online so what's actually go into the service and take a</p>
					<p>0:51look at it you'll get there by clicking on ragimusic</p>
					<p>0:58the system will then load up and we'll show you some top albums top tracks and</p>

					<p>1:34you also need your PIN</p>
					<p>1:45after a few moments the system will load up and in the upper corner of the system</p>
					<p>1:50it will tell you your number of downloads which are available now the</p>
					<p>1:55way the system works is for every song that you download that counts as one of</p>
					<p>2:00your downloads and any music videos you download that counts as two now we're</p>
					<p>2:06gonna go through and actually download a song so that you can see how it all</p>
					<p>2:10works but it really is pretty simple</p>
					<p>2:13you can look at movie that music videos or songs it's entirely up to you so for</p>
					<p>2:19work home it'll show you everything</p>
					<p>2:21music videos on the other hand will show you just videos are available for</p>
					<p>2:25download so for this example we're just gonna type in a song title</p>
					<p>2:31we're going to use happy now you can search by way of artist albums songs or</p>
					<p>2:43videos were going to search all of them are happy</p>
					<p>2:52so as it first comes up</p>
					<p>2:54you'll notice it gives you some search options you can look at all the music</p>
					<p>2:58you can look at just artists albums videos or songs all of which involving</p>
					<p>3:05the word happy so sweet kind of school through here are some artists which</p>
					<p>3:10remain happy there were some albums with happy in the title</p>
					<p>3:16there are some music videos for happy</p>
					<p>3:21and then there are several songs for happy as well</p>
					<p>3:24happen to be an artist named Black happy so all of their songs show up for this</p>
					<p>3:31one we're going to use pronounced happy when we click on the one the song that</p>
					<p>3:38we happen to want it will show you a blow up of the album title a little</p>
					<p>3:43information about the song itself and also gives you the ability to preview it</p>
					<p>3:52now over to the square and this is what gives you the ability to download it so</p>
					<p>4:11you could add it to your wish list and what this will do is after you build up</p>
					<p>4:16after you get a couple of songs maybe you want to download them all at once or</p>
					<p>4:20you could download just this song and continue to choose it's entirely up to</p>
					<p>4:24you for this example we're gonna go on and download this song</p>
