The San Antonio Public Library is a public institution that has a tremendous impact in the community in many ways
the library's mission is to change lives through the power of information, imagination and ideas.
I think the primary responsibility of the library is to offer responsive services and resources.
There are so many ways that we can serve the children and their families.
Today we were doing a program called play and learn which is a program that has an early literacy focus.
We give them opportunities to practice the things that will help get their children ready to learn how to read
and we're giving them more ideas, more ideas about how they can connect with other people in their community; about how they can use our resources
here at the public library.
We offer a lot of programs that engage teens on content creation because that's a population in many areas of the city they are at risk of dropping out
from school and if we can motivate them if we can help them understand the opportunities that they can pursue utilizing technology to develop content
but also as part of that effort to be engaged with other teens to develop team work develop collaboration to come together and think together as a group
so that a they recognize that when you bring various minds together that you can do great things.
What is the role of the library as it relates to digital literacy?
That exposure to technology I think that for our younger children who've grown up with it its a much more natural kind of experience.
In this community we still have a digital divide. Sure mobile devices are becoming much more affordable
but for many communities the struggle to put food on the table; they may not afforded a tablet or even a smartphone. The library provides that
vital access that they need. To go and actually partake and be able to experience digital content a lot of information to get a driver's license,
to get a job, and to apply to go to school. More and more people are having to use computers for these purposes. They can get assistance
in developing a resume and then sending the resume to different potential employers. And that's one of the reasons why we're opening connected central.
Right now we have a case where there's a higher demand for print books and that's what we're providing but we see a trend where there is
also a growing demand for e-books and how do we position ourselves to be able to respond to that demand, is is a question that we ask ourselves.
We have a responsibility to always stay flexible, adaptable, to stay nimble and the strategic plan identifies and provide the tools to allow us to do that.
