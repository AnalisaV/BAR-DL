Welcome to Tutor.com for Libraries.

No matter who you are or what you're working on

we've got you covered with online tutoring in many subject areas,

at all different levels.

Tutor.com is available online through any computer, smartphone or tablet

so getting help when and where you need it is easy.

Just visit your library's website to sign in.

Once you're logged in, you can create a personalized Tutor.com account for free to unlock special features

or just click "No thanks" to go directly to your library's Tutor.com program.

Every tutoring session happens in our easy-to-use online classroom.

On the right side, you can chat with your tutor.

You can also change your avatar and font size in the "Settings" area.

The largest part of the classroom is the two-way interactive whiteboard.

Your tutor will see everything you draw, and vice versa, so it's a great place to work on problems together.

All the tools you need are here.

The whiteboard expands as you use it, like a never-ending sheet of paper.

If you need a clean work space for a new problem, just add another whiteboard.

You can also share files with your tutor, like a photo of the board from your math class.

Just snap a picture with your cell phone and you can work on the problem together.

And when you need help with your writing, you can upload your essay to the classroom and review it with your tutor in real time.

When you're finished, just save a copy of the edited paper to print out or work on later.

Once you end the session, be sure to fill out our survey to let us know how we did.

Then, if you need to, you can email a copy of the session, print it or even watch a video replay.

If you create a personalized Tutor.com account, you can review your session transcripts any time or print them out for your notes.

You can also keep track of your favorite tutors and connect with them whenever they're available.

If your favorites are offline, just tell us what you need help with and we'll find the perfect tutor for you.

The SkillsCenter is available 24-7 and includes carefully chosen test prep materials, worksheets, 
instructional videos, interactive games, customizable flash cards and more.
Visit your library's website today and sign in to Tutor.com.
Get your homework done and get back to your life!
For more information, talk to your local library staff.
